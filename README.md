## Project Description

Recipe Roulette is a community-powered recipe-sharing site: instead of endlessly
scrolling for what to cook, users can spin a virtual recipe roulette wheel and
instantly get a random meal suggestion. It's build to spark inspiration in the
kitchen while fostering a vibrant community of food lovers.

### Key Features

**Submit Recipes**: Share your favorite meals by uploading recipes with ingredients
and step-by-step instructions.

**Roulette Wheel**: Discover a random recipe submitted by other users.

**Bookmark & Comment**: Save your favorite meals for later and leave feedback or
tips for others by commenting on shared recipes.
