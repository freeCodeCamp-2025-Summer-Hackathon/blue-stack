    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook the sticky rice according to the package instructions. Let it cool for 15 minutes before handling.</li>
        <li>Place a bamboo sushi roller or a sheet of parchment paper on a clean surface.</li>
        <li>Lay one sheet of seaweed (nori) on top of the bamboo or parchment, shiny side down.</li>
        <li>Spread a thin, even layer of rice over the seaweed, covering corner to corner. Leave a 1-inch space at the top edge for sealing the roll.</li>
        <li>Arrange the cream cheese, crab, carrots, and cucumber about ⅓ of the way up from the bottom of the seaweed sheet (on the edge closest to you).</li>
        <li>Using the bamboo or parchment as support, tightly roll the seaweed from the bottom upward, pressing gently to form a firm roll.</li>
        <li>Seal the roll by lightly wetting the edge of the seaweed with water. Let the roll rest for 1–2 minutes before slicing.</li>
        <li>Slice into 6–8 bite-sized pieces with a sharp, wet knife. Serve with soy sauce, wasabi, or pickled ginger if desired.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips</h2>
    <p>For best results, chill the finished rolls slightly before cutting. You can also add avocado, sriracha mayo, or sesame seeds for variety.</p>
