        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Lay a large sheet of heavy-duty aluminum foil flat on a clean surface.</li>
            <li>Place a chunk of ground beef (or meat of choice) in the center.</li>
            <li>Season the meat generously with burger bomb seasoning or your preferred blend.</li>
            <li>Add sliced potatoes, carrots, onion, garlic, peppers, mushrooms, and any other veggies or extras you like around or on top of the meat.</li>
            <li>Top everything with a tablespoon of butter.</li>
            <li>Fold the foil tightly to seal it completely, forming a secure packet.</li>
            <li>Place on a grill (or campfire grate) over medium heat and cook for 30–40 minutes until veggies are tender and meat is to temp</li>
            <li>Carefully open foil (watch for steam!) and enjoy right from the pack or plate it up.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Tips</h2>
        <p>For extra flavor, try adding BBQ sauce, Worcestershire, or a splash of soy sauce before sealing. No grill? You can bake it at 400°F for about 35 minutes instead.</p>
