        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This bright and zesty pizza features thin slices of fresh lemon layered over creamy mozzarella, smoky gouda, and tons of fresh basil. Baked on a homemade crust, this pie can be cooked in the oven or finished on a smoker for an unforgettable twist.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <h3>Homemade Pizza Dough</h3>
        <ul>
        <li>2¼ tsp active dry yeast (1 packet)</li>
        <li>1 tsp sugar</li>
        <li>¾ cup warm water (110°F)</li>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Toppings</h3>
        <ul>
        <li>1 large lemon, seeded and thinly sliced into paper-thin rounds</li>
        <li>6–8 oz fresh mozzarella, sliced</li>
        <li>½ cup shredded smoked gouda</li>
        <li>1 large handful fresh basil leaves</li>
        <li>Olive oil, for drizzling</li>
        <li>Cracked black pepper, to taste</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>

        <h3>1. Make the Dough</h3>
        <ol>
        <li>In a small bowl, combine yeast, sugar, and warm water. Let sit for 5–10 minutes until foamy.</li>
        <li>In a mixing bowl, combine flour and salt. Add yeast mixture and olive oil. Mix and knead until smooth and elastic (about 8 minutes).</li>
        <li>Cover and let rise in a warm place for 1 hour, or until doubled in size.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>2. Prep the Toppings</h3>
        <ol>
        <li>Wash the lemon and slice very thinly. Remove all seeds. Pat slices dry with a paper towel.</li>
        <li>Slice the mozzarella and shred the smoked gouda. Wash and dry the basil leaves.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>3. Assemble the Pizza</h3>
        <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 475°F (or preheat smoker with pizza stone to medium-high heat).</li>
        <li>Roll out the dough on a floured surface into a 10–12 inch round. Transfer to a pizza stone or baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Arrange lemon slices in a single layer across the dough.</li>
        <li>Top with slices of mozzarella and a sprinkle of smoked gouda.</li>
        <li>Scatter whole basil leaves generously across the top.</li>
        <li>Drizzle with a bit of olive oil and season with cracked black pepper.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>4. Bake or Smoke</h3>
        <ol>
        <li>Oven method: Bake for 10–14 minutes, or until crust is golden and cheese is bubbling.</li>
        <li>Smoker method: Place on preheated smoker with stone and cook covered for 10–15 minutes until golden and lightly smoky.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>To Serve</h2>
        <p>Let pizza rest for 5 minutes before slicing. Serve warm with an extra drizzle of olive oil or a few torn fresh basil leaves.</p>
